Current state of the generator
----------------------------------
FILL THIS SECTION 
Explain which UML constructs are supported, which ones are not.
What is good in your generator?
What are the current limitations?

Current state of the tests
--------------------------
FILL THIS SECTION 
Explain how did you test this generator.
Which test are working? 
Which are not?

# The functions below aims to simplify the production of

#           Transformation functions: UML2OCL

# The functions below transform each element of the
# UML metamodel into relevant elements in the OCL language.
# This is the core of the transformation. These functions
# are based on the helpers defined before. They can use
# print statement to produce the output sequentially.
# Another alternative is to produce the output in a
# string and output the result at the end.
