Current state of the generator
----------------------------------
FILL THIS SECTION 
Explain which UML constructs are supported, which ones are not.
What is good in your generator?
What are the current limitations?

Current state of the tests

FILL THIS SECTION 
Explain how did you test this generator.
Which test are working? 
Which are not?

# The functions below aims to simplify the production of
# textual languages. They are independent from the

#           Transformation functions: UML2OCL

# The functions below transform each element of the
# UML metamodel into relevant elements in the OCL language.
# This is the core of the transformation. These functions
# are based on the helpers defined before. They can use
# print statement to produce the output sequentially.
# Another alternative is to produce the output in a
# string and output the result at the end.
